# Sorting_Images_processing3
Sorting image pixels, using different sorting algorithms.

Hopefully i'll be adding other sorting algorithms too, but i can also add those to my python repo.
In this, each pixel i first jumbled and then they are sorted accorind to there x and y coordinates, to for the correct picture!
